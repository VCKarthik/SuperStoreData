# 🧾 Superstore Sales Data Storytelling Project

This repository contains all code, visuals, and analysis for **Mini Project 1** of the Data Storytelling course at the University at Buffalo. The project involves narrating a data-driven story using Python and a retail dataset (`Sample - Superstore.csv`) with five thematic visualizations.

## 📘 Project Overview

Retail datasets often hide valuable business insights. In this project, we analyze Superstore sales records to discover patterns in profitability, geographic trends, customer segments, and product performance.

### 📝 Objectives

- Normalize raw CSV data into a structured SQLite database
- Run SQL and pandas-based queries to extract business insights
- Create custom-styled visualizations with matplotlib
- Narrate a public-facing story using five key findings
